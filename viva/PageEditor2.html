                <a href="Home.html" class="home">Home Page</a>
                <p>I created and designed the home page with a suitable background and a simple logo related to our topic "Good Health and Well-Being", using various CSS styles. I added a 
                    navigation bar which allows easy access to other web pages. Furthermore, links have been added to access more contents.</p>
                    
                <a href="Feedback.html" class="feedback">Feedback-form</a>
                <p>Created the feedback form to gather feedback from user. The form was improved with CSS, to make it more dynamic and interesting. JavaScript was used to
                    validation and error handling such as notify users about required fields with an alert message. If the submission was successful, a pop-up message appears
                     on screen as "Thank you for your feedback". </p>
                    
                <a href="Content2.html" class="content-2">Content Page - Healthy Eating</a>
                <p>I have mentioned some nutrition tips in my content page. My aim was to send a message about health protection to our community. </p>
