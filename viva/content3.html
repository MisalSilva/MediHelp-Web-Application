                    <h3>Why Exercise Matters: </h3>
                    <p>Regular physical activity is essential for overall well-being. It strengthens your heart, improves circulation, boosts immune function, and enhances mood. Exercise also plays a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, it promotes better sleep, increases energy levels, and reduces stress and anxiety.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Exercise:</h3>
            <p>Aerobic Exercise: Also known as cardio, aerobic exercise includes activities that increase your heart rate and breathing, such as walking, running, cycling, swimming, and dancing. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week.</p>
            <p>Strength Training: Strength training involves working your muscles against resistance to improve strength, endurance, and muscle mass. This can be achieved through weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, or using resistance bands.</p>
            <p>Flexibility and Balance Exercises: Flexibility exercises, such as yoga and stretching, help improve range of motion and prevent injury. Balance exercises, like Tai Chi, enhance stability and reduce the risk of falls, especially in older adults.</p>
            <p>Functional Training: Functional exercises mimic everyday movements and help improve coordination, stability, and mobility. Examples include squats, lunges, and kettlebell swings.</p>
